# dwc_network_installer

Want to set up your own DWC network server without doing all kinds of command line work?

If the answer is yes, you've come to the right place!

# What these scripts do

These scripts run a series of commands to assist you in installing and uninstalling your server, and many other things.


# PLEASE NOTE

You MUST be running an opperating system that supports APT-GET as a package manager. For example, Raspbian (the native Debian for Raspberry Pi_ and Ubuntu support APT right out of the box

There are two versions of this script available: an English version and a French translation (credits to Dr. Wily)


# If you are having problems or have recommendations on improving either one of these scripts, let me know in the issues section

# TIP

You can skip the auto-update process by using the -s switch

for example

    sudo ./install.sh -s
or






    sudo ./install-fr.sh -s


for the English and French versions respectivly.
